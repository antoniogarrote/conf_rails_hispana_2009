         has been fsynced to disk.  It will wait up to CommitLogSyncBatchWindowInMS
         milliseconds for other writes, before performing the sync.

         This is less necessary in Cassandra
         than in traditional databases since replication reduces the
         odds of losing data from a failure after writing the log
         entry but before it actually reaches the disk.  So the other
         option is "timed," where wirtes may be acked immediately
         and the CommitLog is simply synced every CommitLogSyncPeriodInMS
         milliseconds.

         (each entry will be synced individually).
	 Reasonable values range from a minimal 0.1 to 10 or even more
